v0.1.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Implemented benjymous's awesome "sticky" notifications.  Now when a
  notification is received, it will remain on the digital watch face until
  dismissed by the user.  The idle screen widgets continue to update normally
  in the background.

- Changed the SMS display to show number as well as name.

- Changed the phone ringing notification to one second on, one second off, just 
  like the stock Android phone ringer.
  
- Added test buttons to the phone app.

- Refactored the display notification intent to accept a set of "generic"
  parameters.  An app can simply specify an (optional) icon, title, subtitle, 
  and body text, and it will render correctly on either watch.  The older 
  method of directly setting the oleds or lcd still works too, of course.
  
- Refactored the phone and SMS apps to use the new generic notification 
  framework.
  
- Various minor bugfixes and refactorings.



v0.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added MetaWatch Phone app.  This notifies the watches on an incoming call, 
  and displays a missed call widget on the watch idle screens.

- Start SMS service on boot.  This should fix the bug where the SMS widget
  sometimes didn't redraw after a reboot.

v0.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Start core on boot.
