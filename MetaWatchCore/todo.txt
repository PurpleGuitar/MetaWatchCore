WISH LIST
===============================================================================
    
- Create Google Music app
    - Send notification to watch on track change
    - Display album art?
    - Hook button to skip to next track?

- Create intent wrappers for all intents, not just the busy ones.

- Create constructors for the common configurations of
  the display notification intent.

- Allow different-sized widgets

- Replay last notification (via app menu?)

- Allow apps to interact via application mode

DONE
===============================================================================

x Create phone app.
    x Proper icon.
    x Add permissions to manifest
        - What permissions are needed?
            <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"></uses-permission>
            <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"></uses-permission>
            <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"></uses-permission>
    x Display missed calls on idle screen
    x Get notified on incoming call.
        x We'll need a PhoneStateListener -- borrow from stock MW 
            telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) context.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
            int phoneEvents = PhoneStateListener.LISTEN_CALL_STATE;
            telephonyManager.listen(phoneListener, phoneEvents);
        x Test with real call -- does our listener get notified?        
    x Vibrate watch on incoming call, display caller
    x How do we find out when missed calls have changed?
    x Start service on boot?
